# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2025**

At Roundedapps, your privacy is our priority. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use our apps and services.

## Our Philosophy

We believe the best way to protect your data is to **not collect it in the first place**. Accessbox and our other apps are designed with privacy at their core.

## Information We Don't Collect

- We do **not** collect personal information
- We do **not** track your location
- We do **not** use analytics that identify you
- We do **not** sell or share data with third parties
- We do **not** store your passwords on any server

## Accessbox Specific

Accessbox stores all your data **locally on your device**. Your passwords never leave your device and are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.

### iCloud Sync (Optional)

If you enable iCloud sync, your encrypted data is stored in your personal iCloud account. We cannot access this data. Only you, with your device and credentials, can decrypt it.

## Support Communications

When you contact us for support at support@roundedapps.com, we may retain your email address and correspondence to assist you. We never share this information.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date above.
